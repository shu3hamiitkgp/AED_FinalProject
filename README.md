# Homeless Shelter

## Problem Statement:

Poverty is having an unprecedented impact on the world today. Poverty's health, economic, political, and societal consequences can be devastating, both in the short and long term. They have a significant impact on community health and well-being, the resilience of health-care systems, the stability of national economies, and progress toward the Tenable evolution. 

Managing homeless shelters can be difficult, especially in developing countries with limited infrastructure. There is an overreliance on media outlets, which can lead to false information. There may be some critical information that does not reach immediately and cannot be purified. 

The Homeless Shelter System's purpose is to provide essential guidance and keep users up to date on any nearby shelters, donation facilities, and homeless people can even be employed by selecting the right skillsets with the help of volunteers. Furthermore, this application organizes and manages the resources and responsibilities of each operational unit in humanitarian grounds, reducing the impact of people being homeless and unemployed. 



## Key Functionalities:

1. Registration of the homeless, including location and image.

2. View a report of all incidents in a specific network.

3. Notification to the appropriate authority for response.

4. Verification of reported emergencies to prevent hoax reporting, which will result in user account suspension.

5. Sends alert messages to all registered users about a specific action request, with regular updates.

6. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can also register / login and participate in the event of a disaster to provide additional assistance.

7. Cross-network communication with the ability to seek assistance from other networks if resources are depleted.

8. Management of contingency resources.
